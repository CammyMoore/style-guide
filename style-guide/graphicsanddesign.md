# Graphics and Design
Our content (especially the one on our websites) must be accessible to people with disabilities. To ensure this, we must see that the content is supported in various devices and browsers. Check the compatibility with older versions also. The graphics used must be simple and easy to understand. Always provide alternate text (alt text) with the image, video or any other multimedia. This alt text is read by screen readers and helps those that are visually impaired understand the graphics on the screen.

## Working with Designs
* All text must be inside a rectangular grid/box for better format and visibility.
* Table headers must be clearly demarcated. Also, if links are present inside the table, preferably keep them in the same cell as their content/description.

* For Webpage content, avoid multiple frames.
* Avoid horizontal scrolling of content.

## Working with Multimedia
* For audio and videos, always provide closed-caption text (CC text) and transcripts.
* When you have links or hotspots on an image (which is called image-map) for the user to click, then always list the text links below the image.
* As the links are not numbered, also ensure to list the links/hotspots and text links in the order that you prefer so that the user reads them in the same way.
* Wherever possible, provide cl4ear description of the image. A well written description helps users with disability to understand the content better.
* All images, audio, video, and animations must have an alt text that describes the element. The alt text must convey to the user all the important information about the element.
