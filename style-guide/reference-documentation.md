# Reference Documentation
A reference document can be defined as a type of document that outlines procedures that are followed when an activity is undertaken, be it about travel, cooking, programming, teaching, or any other thing.
In the programming context, it is supposed to provide all the elements associated with the technologies. It should be a collection of various objects related to the languages like their classes, libraries, object models, programming language constructs, etc.
Reference documentation needs to be consistent in terms of the way details are provided in it. The document must be logically modularized having predictable headings and structure which will help developers about what they are looking for. Providing links with related topics is a common feature of any reference document.
## Article Title
While mentioning any programming element in the document, use the name of the element followed by its type. If the same named element is existent or shared by other elements then add a differentiator. Use the parent element name or technology or the product name to differentiate. Choose it wisely so that it helps get any search results for customers finding the article for the correct product or element.  
**Examples:**  
Capitalize function  
Letters.Capitalize function  
Asset.Capitalize function  
Capitalize function (SAP)
## Elements of a reference article 
The following table gives more details on typically what kind of information should be provided in reference articles. Sections mentioned below may vary depending on the language, product, or technology being documented.

|Section|Contains|
|:---|:---|
|**Title and Description**|It should present the name of the element and a brief description of it in a concise sentence. Try to explain what the element does or represents. <br>**Example:** <br>CalculateEMI method (SAP) <br>Calculates the EMI for various loans sanctioned for multiple purposes.|
|**Declaration**|A language construct specifying element properties such as its type or the nature of how it should be used across <br> **Example:** <br>float rate = 8.5;  //Declares variable rate to be a floating number <br>boolean isEligible(income);  //Declares method to check eligibility for loan|
|**Syntax**|It is a set of rules on how to write any detail in programming languages. It sets a context giving the convenience of writing and understanding the topic. <br>**Example:** <br>Loan.CalculateEMI (Principal, Rate, Period, CalcMethod, PaymentType);|
|**Parameters**|If elements have parameters, try to provide as much useful details as possible for each parameter. Like, <br>Data type (*int, String, double,* etc.)<br>Mandatory or Optional<br>Input or Output or InOut<br>Try not to repeat the words in the parameter name or the data type.<br>**Example:**<br>*Principal*<br>Required. A **numeric** value that is owed by someone at any point of time. It is the amount on which the interest is calculated.<br>*Rate*<br>Required. A **numeric** value that represents the proportion of a loan that is charged as interest to the borrower<br>*Period*<br>Required. A **numeric** value to know for how many years/days the loan is taken. Usually, it is counted in the number of days.<br>*CalcMethod*<br>Optional. This is another **numeric** value that can be sent to calculate EMI considering either 360 or 365 days a year. If not sent, the default value to be considered is 365.<br>*PaymentType*<br>Optional. This is a **string** parameter that gives details on what should be the payment type of the EMI, whether to be Advance payment, Arrears, or Monthly. As this is an optional parameter, the default value is Monthly. That means an account will be debited for EMI calculated amount.|
|**Return Value**|If the element returns any value, then provide its data type details and give more information. If the return data type is Boolean, describe the conditions of its various values on various conditions.<br>**Examples:**<br>*double diffAmount doGetDifference ( Principal, PaidAmount);*<br>Here data type for return value is of type **Double** which holds the difference between the amount which was borrowed originally and the amount which is paid finally.<br>*Boolean flag isLeapYear (year);*<br>This method returns a value of data type **Boolean** which makes the flag true if it is a Leap year else it will be false.|
|**Remark**|There can be situations where additional information about an element or any important details about it is not evident from its syntax, parameters, or return values. For example, a remark can be provided on what are the recommended don’ts about the element or parameters. And if those are used then there can be errors.<br>**Example:**<br>Value of *Rate* should not be a *negative number* else it would calculate the negative amount which will not be expected.<br>*Period* cannot be of zero value else it will give an infinite number issue.|
|**Example**|This is an example that illustrates how to use the programming element. For more information about writing useful code examples.|
|**Requirements or Applies to**|Provide details on dependency, if there are any related to language or platform for using the element.<br>**Example:**<br>TermEMI Method (SAP)|
|**See also**|It should provide references or links to more information about how to use the element. More information of reference and links of related elements.<br>**Examples:**<br>HoldEMI Method<br>StartEMI, ReStartEMI, TermEMI, CalculateEMI Methods|
|**Property Value**|It is a description of a property or a field. Mention its value as per requirement. Give details if it holds any default value along with its data type.<br>**Example:**<br>*Transit Period*<br>Number<br>It is a **numeric** value that represents the number of days of transit from the date of sanction of a loan to the actual date when disbursement of the loan amount. The default value is 15 business working days.|
|**Warning message**|If any unusual activity is performed, which can lead to an issue, the element can give a warning. All the warnings should be self-explanatory. All those should be listed describing conditions under which they can occur.<br>**Examples:**<br>*“Start date of the loan is back valued.”*<br>The start date is made before the actual system date on the day of loan creation.<br>*“Actual tenor days are equal to the approved tenor days.”*<br>In this case, whenever there will be a request to extend tenor days then there can be an issue as both actual and approved tenor days are the same.|
|**Error message**|Similar to warning messages, error messages are to be shown whenever anything is performed which is not correct. All the error messages should be self-explanatory and those should be listed describing conditions under which they can occur.<br>**Examples:**<br>*“Amount entered Is out of the limit.”*<br>If the loan is tried to be created out of the granted limit of a customer.<br>*“Inputted date has to be in YYYYMMDD format”*<br>If the user enters incorrect dates i.e., 20231602 instead of 20230216.|
|**Exceptions**|If the element throws an exception, list them the describe the conditions under which they occur.<br>**Examples:**<br>NullPointerException – Null found in the operation<br>NumberFormatException – The number format is invalid<br>FileNotFoundException – Looking for a file that does not exist|
|**Permissions/Accessibility**|Security permissions are applied to access the elements.<br>**Examples:**<br>Private Income ()<br>Public InterestRate ()|

Reference articles are not limited to details that are provided in the preceding table. There can be descriptions of members, methods, inbuilt classes, and a lot more.
There are ways to generate documentation and comments from the source code as well. However, review those comments for the quality and appropriateness of the comments. Make sure that non-sensitive or not useful details are not shared which are not suitable for the documentation.
