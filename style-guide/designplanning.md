# Design Planning
Design planning includes the additional design aspects that you need to consider along with writing your content. This would include considering aspects like font type and style, Heading styles, layout for tables and lists, theme colors to be used, paragraph formatting, image selection, etc. All the design aspects would be used to beautify your content to make it presentable and attractive to the audience. Design planning would also help you develop the flow of the content that would make it easy for the readers to navigate through your content.
## Collaboration with Stakeholders
Before you begin writing, you must collaborate with the different stakeholders related to your project and come up with a content plan. There may be different teams and individuals that you may be working with. You need to consult with all of them and understand their point-of-view before starting the project. Some of these stake holders may include graphics design team, VFX/video edits team, project managers, sales team, business analysts, UI team, etc. You can share your initial ideas with the stakeholders and ask for their feedback and also ideas. Based on this you can determine the design approach for your project.

## Layout
Based on the type of content you are writing, the layout for the content needs to be decided. The page size (A2, A4, etc.), orientation (portrait or landscape), number of columns, spacing, alignment, etc. needs to be defined at the start. This layout has to be followed for all the content and must be shared with the entire team and stakeholders. 
If you are writing content for a website or blog, then the page layout that best fits the online site must be considered. At times, the content is shown in a half page layout or any other design. These aspects must be considered, so that the content is easily readable on the website. Also consider the layout of the other elements with the content so that the images, graphs, etc. are in tandem with the content and do not overwhelm the content text. You can define a specific design for some content that can be used as a standard across all pages. Some content that you can standardize can be definitions, references, procedures, step-by-step instructions, tips, etc.

## Template
Creating a template provides a clear framework for all the team members to understand what is expected out of the project. The template design should match the brand identity and use brand colors that are visually appealing. Some of the points to consider when designing the template are as follows:

* Create built-in styles for headings, sub-headings, bullets, tables, etc. This will reduce the manual formatting task required for this type of content.
* Most documentation applications or Web blogs have pre-defined styles already configured. Edit these styles to your preferred style instead of adding new styles from scratch. 
* You will need to add only a few styles specifically with regards to headings, sub-headings, bullets, tables, and body text. Try to limit the number of styles to keep the template clean and less confusing for its users.
* Ensure to add margins and adequate spaces for the users of the template to add different volume of content. 
* Ensure consistency for all styles used throughout the template document.
