# Capitalization
We generally capitalize only the first word in a sentence and nouns. Nouns would include names of people, products, brands, etc. This capitalization helps to emphasize our products and services in a better way to our customer.
* Capitalization is used in the following instances:
    * First word of every sentence
    * Title
    * Headings
    * Proper nouns
    * Labels
* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence.
* Avoid capitalization between words unless it is required. For example, it should be Intercontinental not InterContinental.
* Do not use all words in uppercase for emphasis. Instead, you can make the word bold or italics.
* If using slash between words, then you may capitalize the word after slash if required. For example, Name/Address.
* You may use capitalization in your graphics to emphasis any part of the graphics.

## Title
In title-capitalization, you would capitalize each word in a sentence or a phrase. This is usually used for position of a person (Vice President Marketing), article and white paper titles, book names, blog titles, etc. Some of the guidelines to follow for title capitalization are as follows:
* Do not capitalize articles a, an, and the unless they are the first word in a sentence. For example, The Issues a Company Faces.
* Avoid capitalizing words with less then four letters unless they are the first word. Some of these words can include to, of, for, in, on, etc. For example, Products for Businesses.
* Do not capitalize conjunctions such as and, but, or, nor, yet, etc. For example, Products and Services of Hornbill.
* Capitalize all other words such as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs.
* Capitalize words after hyphen if the word would be capitalized without the hyphen too. For example, Copy-Paste.
* Capitalize all titles, labels and terms that appear on screen in the user interface of the tool or software. The exception being if the word on-screen is in lower case. For example, Click Insert.
* If the content contains code, type it as it is ignoring the capitalization rules.
