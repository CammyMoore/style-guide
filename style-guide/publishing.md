# Tips before Final Publishing
Here are some tips that can help you before publishing your finalized content for your audience:
* **Review**: You must review your content by either your senior or from a professional editor if possible. It is always a good idea to get your content reviewed from someone else as they can find out any mistakes or issues that you may have missed. You must be also open to feedback received in form of the reviewerâ€™s comments.
* **Keywords**: Our content must be SEO-friendly. To ensure this, check if you can include the keywords in the Titles and Headings of the content. If this is not possible, at least ensure that the keywords appear in the first few lines of the content. This will help the Web crawlers scan and identify the content in a faster way.
* **Spell Check**: Always spell check your content as you may have made any typos or mistakes when developing the content. Go through each and every suggestion of spell check to ensure that you have not mistyped or erroneously used a similar sounding or similar spelled word.
* **Headings**: Ensure that the headings are clear and easy to understand. Ensure that there are no gaps in headings and repetition of content is avoided. 
* **Gap**: If you have time in your hand, then review the content you have written the next day with a fresh mind. You are more attentive in the morning and you might add anything that you may have missed the earlier day.
* **Summarize**: Try to keep the content short and crisp. Remove words, sentences, paragraphs, and sections that are not required. Also, do not repeat same content in a rephrased manner.
* **Re-Read**: Read your work again after you finish it. You may find some mistakes or edits when you re-read your work.
* **Objective**: Check that your content has fulfilled the objective for which it was written. This should directly benefit the Customer who is reading the content.
* **Voice**: Also, ensure that the voice of our brand comes out through your content. It should be warm, friendly, clear and crisp.
