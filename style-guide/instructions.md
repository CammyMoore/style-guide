# Instructions
When writing step-by-step instructions for a procedure, you will have to write multiple steps. These procedures may be simple procedures or complex procedures. 
## Writing Simple Procedures
You must ensure that only one user action is mentioned for each numbered step. Also, ensure that consistent formatting is used for each step.
Example:
1.	On the initial screen, click and drag to select the icons.
2.	Right-click on the icons.
### Using brackets
You can use angle brackets (>) to show a linear sequence of action. The brackets must have a space on both sides.
Example:
Click **Layout** > **Orientation** > **Landscape** 
## Writing Complex Procedures
* Complex procedures have multiple steps and may involve steps across different pages, Web sites, applications and tools. Always number your steps for a complex procedure. Some other guidelines that you can adhere to for complex procedures are as follows:
* Try to limit the steps to a maximum of seven steps. If there are more steps, check if you can break the procedure into two parts. 
* Use headings to ensure that the reader finds the instructions that they require quickly. Preferably the heading must describe what the reader can do viewing the steps. For example, Add a new file.
* Ensure that you use parallel construction for all headings. For example, if one heading is Add a new file, the next will be Delete a file and not Deleting a file or File deletion.
* End each step with a period.
* Use verbs that tell the customer about the activity that they will perform after reading the steps. Examples of such verbs would include Add, Delete, Save, etc.
* Number each step separately and do not combine steps unless the step is too short.
* Use consistent sentence structure and style for all steps.
* Capitalize the first word in every step.
* Do not forget to add minor steps that may be small but relevant to proceed. For example, Click **OK**.
* Format the steps consistently throughout a procedure.
* Do not leave any step sentence incomplete or break the sentence to add it to the next step.

Some tips for writing steps are as follows:
* When the step instruction appears on the interface image, you need not provide the specific location like top-left or at the bottom, etc.
* On the first step, always add from where the customer will begin. 
Example:
In the **Start** menu, click the browser icon.
* At times, you may need to provide an additional introductory step to avoid confusion.
Example:
On the desktop, click the **Start** menu.
