# Tips for better content styling

## Read your content
Read your content aloud to see that it sounds like someone is speaking to you. The more friendly the content seems, the better it connects with the audience. Check the two examples below:
* x Edit Address London to Glasgow 
* ✓ You can edit the address from London to Glasgow

## Working with Periods
Periods are usually used for paragraphs and body text. You can skip periods at the end of Headings, Subheadings, UI Titles and standalone likes with less than three words. For example:
* ✓ Heading – <span style="font-size: 14px">**Working with a File**</span>
* ✓ Sub heading – **Saving a File**
* ✓ Bullet text 
    * Change font
    * Save text

## Use of Space
One space should be given after period, question mark and colon before starting the next sentence. Not required if the sentence or questions ends with the punctuation mark. For example:
* Where are you from? What do you do?

## Minimalism
Use the shortest way to portray an ideas in a sentence. For example:
* x If you're ready to purchase a new refrigerator for your organization, contact your white goods account representative.
* ✓ Ready to buy a refrigerator? Contact us.

## Review and revise
Review your content and if you have a better way or word choice to revise it then edit it.

## Be Specific
Preferably start your content/sentence with that is most important and get to the point as soon as possible so that the audience quickly understands the idea you are trying to present.

## Serial Comma Usage
Do not miss adding a comma after 3 or more items are listed. This is called the Oxford comma or serial comma. For example:
* ✓ Apples, Oranges, and Bananas

## Be Brief
When revieing your content, cut any excess words or unrequired sentences. This will give your audience the right information to move forward.

## Conversational language
You may use contractions such as let’s, you’re, we’re etc. in a conversational tone when the content calls for it. However, if in doubt or unsure, expand the usage. For example:
* x The experience you provide impacts your ability to get and keep the best people. That is why organizations are investing in technology to create new digital experiences faster. In this report, you will find out why customer and employee experiences matter.
* ✓ The experience you provide impacts your ability to get and keep the best people. That’s why organizations are investing in technology to create new digital experiences faster. In this report, you’ll find out why customer and employee experiences matter.

## Capitalization
Capitalize only proper nouns or names or the first word of a sentence, heading or phrase. For example:
* x Hornbill Docs Customer
* ✓ Hornbill Docs customer
