# Style Guide

## Questions for now

Info box titles capped down so far, I've been capitalizing them—correct?
Using leading capital for Book when referring to an HDocBook.
(explanation: in the document this is fairly consistently captialised, suggesting that this is what's wanted. it's an in-company product, which can be treated as a proper noun.)
We need a consistent styling for browser/GUI buttons. In all uses we have title case. Sometimes they are enclosed in quotes, and at other times given Bold+Italic. Double quotes WITH bold and italic is probably overkill.
Styling for keyboard keys is also inconsistent—mostly title case with double quotes. I suggest bold+italic for both keyboard keys and GUI buttons.
Link for markdown bookmark links in notes box in markdown.md is not working.

## Notes/questions for later

Styling – two-line section breaks, and those coded after snippets?
Add instructions for 'Git fetch from main branch' to complex-edits?
Check point 10 of simple edits - does the button really say that twice?
Some references to GUI buttons are given special styling (e.g. ***Repositories***, in simple-edits). Should we use that everywhere, nowhere, or in which special cases? 
There is currently an enforced double newline before H2
Double quotes are preferred in US English, but this is a weak preference and can be overridden

## Vocab

HDocBooks
Hornbill Docs
Hornbill's Documentation Team (proper noun for the formal title of the team)
the Hornbill Docs team ("team" as common noun for informal reference to the above)
Hornbill HDocBook Tools
hdoc (for the CLI tool)
Git
GitHub
Git actions and objects decapped/treated common noun: Git pull, Git clone, your fork, this pull request
Visual Studio Code or VS Code
Markdown
frontmatter
Book (when referring to an HDocBook, "book" when referring to any other book)
Library (when referring to the HDocBook Library, library when referring to a generic library, software library, etc.)

Compound nouns and compound adjectives:
- Two-word nouns and two-word adjectives *not immediately followed by a noun* have no hyphen: on the top level. this is open source.
- Two-word adjectives that *are followed by a noun* have a hyphen: top-level domain. open-source project.
- The following are common examples of the above: command line/command-line, open source/open-source, top level/top-level.


## Styling

General:
- Using American spelling and styling.
- No Oxford comma unless a list is complex or contains many "and"s. 
- Double quotes.
- Unspaced parenthetical em dash—like this!
    - Em dash can be typed using numpad alt+0151 (hold alt and type the numbers one after another).
- Bullet lists: no trailing punctuation for short, simple items and incomplete sentences.
    - If the items are long (long and complex single sentences or multiple sentences), use trailing punctuation.
    - Aim for consistency in this per-list, per-page, per-Book, and across the Library, in that order of priority.
    - For example, if a bullet list has many short items and one long and complex item which cannot be split or simplified, use punctuation for the whole list.
- No double spaces (apart from tabs).
- Generic terms treated as a common noun/no caps: home page.
    - Always default to common noun unless you can justify exactly why it's a proper noun.
    - Examples of justification: Hornbill company products, team titles.
- Headings in title case (first word and all content words capitalized: The Old Man and the Sea)
- No capital after colon in body text (apart from for quotations or proper nouns)

Referring to computer controls:
- Leading caps/title case and double quotes for keyboard keys: "Enter".
- Leading caps/title case and quotes for references to GUI buttons: "Click Here".
- Screen directions as noun with no hyphen: near the top right of the screen.
    - Screen directions as an adjective have a hyphen: the bottom-left button.
