# Accessibility Guidelines
Our products at Hornbill are created keeping in mind all the people with all abilities across the globe. We are especially sensitive to the diversity in culture, geography, abilities and disabilities. Even our content must be clean and simple for all readers. This will provide better accessibility to our readers. Some of the guidelines to be noted when focusing on accessibility are as follows:

## Reader first approach
Use words or phrases that are not language-sensitive. Some of the words that you can replace to sound better are as follows:

|Use|Instead of|
|:---|:---|
|Hard-of-hearing|Deaf, hearing-impaired|
|Developmental disability, cognitive disability|Slow learner, mentally handicapped|
|People with disabilities|Disabled people. Handicapped people|
|Has cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis|Affect by/Suffers from Epilepsy|
|Is unable to speak, uses synthetic speech|Dumb, mute|
|Has mobility or physical disability, has limited mobility|Lame, crippled, handicapped|
|Has low vision|Blind, vision impaired, sight impaired|
|Person without a limb, person with a prosthetic limb|Missing a limb, maimed|

## Structure your content 
You must structure your content for easy readability and location. To do this:
* **Use Headings** – Use different heading styles to show the hierarchy levels of the content
* **Avoid directions** – Directional pointing to a location on screen must be avoided. These words include left right, top, bottom, above, below, up, down, and so on. For example, avoid writing content like ‘Click on icon on the top left corner of the screen to change the settings.’ A better way to write it would be ‘Click on the **Settings** icon.’
* **Visually enhance the important pointers** – Use tables to summarize huge content in a concise way if possible. You can also use bullet and numbered lists to enhance the content.

## Alternate input methods
Mouse and Keyboard are the most popular input methods. However, if any of our products are using alternate input methods for better accessibility, then you must mention the same in the documentation. These alternative input methods can include Voice recognition devices, devices that read from gestures and actions, joysticks, etc. If providing specific step lists for these input methods, avoid verbs like ‘Click’ or ‘Swipe’ which may not be used in that input method. 

## Quick Tips
Some more quick tips to enhance Accessibility in your content are as follows:
* **Use parallel writing** for similar content which is grammatically correct and sounds better. For example, reading, writing, and listening. 
* **Avoid line breaks** in sentences to put a content in a different line. The screen reader software will have a pause if a continuous sentence has a line break.
* **Provide a detailed description** when providing a link. For example, instead of ‘Click here to read more’, use ‘Click here to read about the different types of products.’
* **Try to read the text** as it would be read by a screen reader. Try to keep only one verb in the sentence and keep the sentence structure simple.
* **Spell out words** like i.e., plus, etc. Some screen readers misread texts and symbols so best to put them in an elaborate way.
* **Visually highlight** the link text with color and underline.
