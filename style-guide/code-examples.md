# Code Examples
Code examples illustrate how to use a programming element to implement specific functionality. These examples can be:
* Simple; single-line examples explained with few texts.
* Short; more than one-line examples that are self-explanatory illustrating specific points.
* Long; these are examples that can illustrate multiple complex scenarios, features, or best practices.

Code examples help developers to:
* Learn or explore technology or a language.
* Perform and create some proof of concept during planning, to assess the technology.
* Refer to how to resolve issues in case of any issues.
* Write and debug the code.

These code examples are helpful for developers because they can simply copy the code snippet from the documentation or re-write code examples as per their requirements.
For code examples to be useful, one should identify tasks, scenarios, and situations which are meaningful for users and then create code examples to illustrate those. Examples that demonstrate product features are useful only when they address the problems that developers are trying to solve.
## Guidelines for planning code examples
* Create brief examples that become typical examples of key development tasks. Start with simple examples, followed by short ones, and finally long ones. Make sure that the common scenarios are covered before building complexity.
* Give priority to frequently used elements. Elements that can be difficult to understand should be planned in such a way that enough description is provided for them to be able to understand.
* Scenarios described in code examples should be realistic. Scenarios that are obvious to understand, do not need  to create code examples.
* Code examples should be easy enough to be scanned or understood without anyoneâ€™s help or guidance. Examples that are relatively complicated or need an explanation for their understanding, should be kept for tutorials or walkthroughs. Those can be explained step-by-step about its working.
* Introduce the scenario by giving a description. Explain anything that might not be clear from the code. Provide the requirements and dependencies details for using or running the example.
* Code examples should be easily accessible and runnable for developers. If it demonstrates interactive and animated features, then try providing a way for the developer to run the example directly from the content page.
* It is important to use appropriate keywords, and linking strategies so that the code examples given by you have got good visibility and usability. It should be written in such a way that it is well-reachable by other search engine optimization (SEO) techniques. Try adding links to relevant code example pages and content pages to improve SEO across your content.
## Guidelines for writing code examples
* Codes should be written in such a way that it is reusable. It should be generic in its type. Give proper instructions to developers to modify before they use it. Describe the functionality of the code example without stating obvious things.
* Show expected output of the example, either by using code comments within code examples or in a separate section after the example.
* Always write secure code. For example, there must be a validation on user inputs, never use hard-code passwords in code, no sensitive information should be passed through the code.
* Use necessary code-analysis tools which detects security or vulnerability issues. There are tools which do not let developers to commit code in source code repositories.
* Consider accessibility requirements for code that created UI. For example, include alternate text for images.
* Provide details of exception handling when it is necessary for the code example. Catch exception only when it is manageable for the program to give expected output else throw it for it to terminate.
* Always compile and test your code. Run cases which will make each line of the code to be executed and tested. There are various tools which will help checking on this to check code coverage.
