# Accessibility - Text and Graphics
* Keeping a high contrast ensures better readability for people having low vision. However, the contrast must not hurt the eyes. All colors for your fonts must be chosen carefully. Avoid hard-to-read color combinations such a grey and white, light blue and white, red and green, etc.
* Avoid using shadows, background images and watermarks as they hinder the reading.
* Use both colors and symbols to convey the information. For example, use a X sign with a red color to show that something is restricted or prohibited. Ensure that text color is not altered due to the contrast settings.
* Avoid using tints.
