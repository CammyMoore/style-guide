# Document Quality Standard (DQS)

High-quality documentation is an essential aspect of software development, product management, and user assistance. It helps in understanding, utilizing, and maximizing the potential of a product or a system. 

## Purpose
This document outlines the criteria and guidelines for producing high-quality software product documentation that will be published on the Hornbill Docs site. The goal of this guide is to ensure that documentation espouses clarity, comprehensiveness, accuracy, and drives user learning and engagement.

## Scope
The quality guidelines applies to all forms of documentation, including user manuals, online help, technical specifications, release notes and embedded "in the moment" help within Hornbill's products.
