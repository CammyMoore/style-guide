# Content without Bias

As our communication and content at Hornbill is consumed all over the world, we need to be sensitive and critical that our content is not biased. The content must be inclusive for all and cater to all diversities. Some of the pointers to note to ensure that the content is not biased are as follows:
* Ensure that the communication is inclusive and does not hurt or target any specific race or culture. Ensure that your content does not hurt the feelings of the Asian, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latinx, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Indigenous People.
* Do not use disrespectful or derogatory terms.
* Be considerate when speaking about job roles, families and family structures.
* Use culturally appropriate content and do not use slangs.
* Do not make any generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures.
* Avoid using pronouns such as he, she, his, hers, etc. Instead, you can try the following:
    * Rewrite the sentence with a plural noun and pronoun (they, their, or them) in generic references to a single person
    * Use the word person or individual 
    * Mention the persons role (for example, employee, reader, learner etc.)
    * Use articles instead of pronoun (for example, the files instead of his files or her files)
    * Write in second person (you)
